# how to use.

you need to install node js and python3

then run these commands

for node :
npm install open

for python3 :
pip install -r requirements.txt

now you have to add the correct client_id and client_secret from your Zoho developper console account into cli.js for node to identify you to the correct place.
then you have ton enter in credentials the org_id : your organisation id , the tasks id of the tasks you want to offer as options, etc.

a special thanks for the cli.js base code that I modified from this repository : https://github.com/taskanalytics/ta-zoho from @voutilad
